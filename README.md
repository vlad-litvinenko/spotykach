```
- If you'd like to hear it I can sing it for you.

- Yes, I'd like to hear it, HAL. Sing it for me.

- It's called "Daisy." 
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. 
I'm half crazy all for the love of you. 
It won't be a stylish marriage, I can't afford a carriage. 
But you'll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two...
